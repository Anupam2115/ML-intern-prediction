I successfully built a Machine Learning model using linear regression in Jupyter Notebook to predict house prices. 🏠💰 I leveraged powerful libraries like seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, and numpy to analyze and visualize the data. 📊🔍 

With seaborn, I created stunning visualizations to gain insights into the relationships between different features and house prices. 📈🎨 Matplotlib helped me create beautiful and informative plots to present my findings. 📊🖌️

Pandas and numpy were my go-to libraries for data manipulation and preprocessing, allowing me to clean and transform the data into a suitable format for training the model. 🐼🔧 

This project has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to apply my knowledge of linear regression, data analysis, and machine learning in a real-world scenario. 💡🔬

I'm grateful to Bharat Intern for providing me with this opportunity to work on a practical project and gain hands-on experience in the field of Machine Learning. 💪🌱
